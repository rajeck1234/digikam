TODO list for post-GSoC 2019 on backend of face recognition:

* Remove old codes of face recognition algorithms not based on DNN ==> DONE.

* New face clustering algorithms should be studied and implemented.
  A candidate can be [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8359265 Density-Based Multiscale Analysis for Clustering in Strong Noise Settings With Varying Densities] (DBMAC/DBMAC-II).

* Implement universal object detection module that allow user to import customize model.
