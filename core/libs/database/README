There are more than one database managed by digiKam :

- Core database which host all albums, items, searches data.
- Thumbnails database to host image thumbs with wavelets compression images.
- Similarity database to host image finger-prints with computed Haar algorithms.
- Face database to host face areas on images and face histograms used by faces recognition.
  For technical reasons, code is located in libs/facesengine/facedb.
