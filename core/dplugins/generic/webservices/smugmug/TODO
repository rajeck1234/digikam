TODO:

* GSoC 2018 export tools:
 ++ Port to O2:
    - Remove totally email, password field
    - Remove totally categories related methodes (now still let in comments)
    - Codes for anonymous login (enable/disable some functionalities)
    - When finishing uploading an image, remove it from transferQueue
 ++ Factorization: 
    - Like in Flickr -> Button Change Account only add new user accounts
                     -> Button Remove Account (or Logout) really removes an account
                     -> A combo box to choose account at login if user has many accounts
    - Instead of open browser for login with QDesktopServices::openUrl(url) (which is slow and leaves an unpleasant tab 
      when finishing login), maybe we should use QWebEnginePage (?) 
 

* Minor improvements:
 - Fix button enable/disable when image list is empty (ImagesList)
 - Fix button enable/disable on new album dialog
 - Check FileSizeLimit before upload
 - Keywords, GPS coordinates support
 - Implement validators for email and password

* Short term:
 - video file upload - do not perform resize

* Long term:
 - Synchronize with local album (upload/download)
 - Virtual albums support
 - Support for adding categories/subcategories (is this needed?)
 - SmugVault support?
